`tt clean`, `tt logrotate`, `tt status`. It shows suitable apps, in case of the pattern doesn't
contain delimiter `:`, and suitable instances otherwise.
- support tt environment directories overriding using environment variables:
  * TT_CLI_REPO_ROCKS environment variable value is used as rocks repository path if it is set and
there is no tt.repo.rocks in tt configuration file or tt.repo.rocks directory does not include
repository manifest file.
  * TT_CLI_TARANTOOL_PREFIX environment variable value is used for as tarantool installation prefix

## [1.1.0] - 2023-05-02

### Changed
- ``tt install tarantool`` without version specification now installs the latest release.
- ``tt install/search tarantool-ee`` now uses credentials from `tarantool.io` customer zone.
  Also, installation now requires specifying the version.
- ``tt search tarantool-ee`` options changed. A new `--version` flag has been added to allow
  search for a specific release. The `--dev` and `--dbg` options have been merged into a
  single `--debug` option.
- ``tt search`` now uses subcommands for searching tarantool/tarantool-ee/tt binaries

### Added

- ``--dynamic`` option for `tt install tarantool` command to build non-static tarantool executable.

### Fixed

- ``tt connect`` command does not break a console after executing `os.exit()` command anymore.

## [1.0.2] - 2023-04-21

### Fixed

- ``tt cartridge`` command takes into account run dir path from the `tt` environment. So most
  of the `tt cartridge` sub-commands are able to work without specifying `--run-dir` option.
- ``tt install`` command checks it's write rights to binary and include directories before
  installing binaries.

### Changed
  - ``tt install/uninstall`` command line interface is updated. Program names have become
  sub-commands with their own options.

### Added

- A configurable variable `cluster_cookie` for `tt create cartridge` template.
- ``tt build`` accepts application name for building.
- Creating wal, vinyl and memtx directories for `tt pack`. If these directories
  are not located in the same directory in the environment for packing, the result package
  will contain separate snap/vinyl/wal directories for corresponding artifacts.

### Fixed

- Packing symlinks into RPM package.

### Changed

- ``tt uninstall`` does not ask version if only one version of a program is installed.
- ``tt rocks init`` is disabled.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-03-23

### Added

- Follow-up message support for application templates.
- tarantool_layout config option to enable compatibility mode with tarantoolctl artifacts layout.
  If this option is set to `true`, `tt` will not create sub-directories for runtime artifacts such
  as control socket, pid file and log file. This option affects only single instance applications.
- An ability to set different directories for WAL, vinyl and snapshots artifacts.
- ``tt instances`` command to print a list of enabled applications.
- SSL options for ``tt connect`` command.
- An ability to pass arguments to a connect command.
- ``tt binaries`` command. It shows a list of installed binaries and their versions.

### Changed

- Do not use `make` command options for `tarantool` build if `MAKEFLAGS` environment variable
is set.
- `binaries`, `build`, `check`, `clean`, `create`, `install`, `instances`, `logrotate`, `pack`,
  `restart`, `run`, `start`, `status`, `stop`, `uninstall` require environment configuration file.

### Fixed

- Output of the ``help`` with all commands.
- Allow more characters for URI credentials.

  arguments to interact with all instances of the environment simultaneously.
- Starting from version 2.8.1, we can specify configuration parameters of
  tarantool via special environment variables.
  Added support for this feature when running older versions of tarantools via tt.

### Changed
