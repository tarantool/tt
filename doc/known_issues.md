## Do not set the box.cfg.background

`tt start` daemonizes a Tarantool process itself. The [box.cfg.background
setting][cfg-background] does the same thing from a Tarantool process. These
features conflict with each other. As a result, `tt status` shows an invalid
status of a Tarantool instance, and it is unable to stop the instance
with `tt stop`.

You should never set `box.cfg.background = true` in an application code that
is started by `tt`.
